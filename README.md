# MertcanBaykal - 2DCombatPlatformerDemo
 
This is a personal project that aims to test my skills and improve my knowledge about Unity Game Engine, Game Development and C#. 

It is a 2D Combat & Platformer with pixel art style. The level design is simple because this is just a simple showcase focusing on the gameplay elements and enviromental effects.
